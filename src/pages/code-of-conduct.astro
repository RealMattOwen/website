        We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
        for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
        tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual
        language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
        including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
        Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
        expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the
        conference organisers.
