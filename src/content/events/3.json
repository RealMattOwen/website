      "description": "Explore ComfyUI, a powerful tool for visualising data pipelines in diffusion models. We'll start with an introduction to diffusion models and their significance. Then letâ€™s discover how ComfyUI simplifies the understanding and debugging of complex data flows through practical applications and real-world examples. Highlights include Stable Diffusion 3, SDXL lighting, AI upscaling, and more. Gain insights into how I optimise my diffusion model workflows with this intuitive interface."
