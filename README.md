# nn1.dev

Welcome to the [Northamptonshire Dev Club](https://nn1.dev) website. Your contributions are welcome! The only prerequisite for this project to run locally is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). It is built using the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). There is a continuous deployment set up against the `main` branch.
